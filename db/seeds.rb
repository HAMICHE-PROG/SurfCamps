# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# location = Location.new(name: "Bali", average_price: 3, description: "One fo the best Surfing Spots")
# location.save

# location1 = Location.new(name: "Maldives", average_price: 3, description: "An Amazing Villa close to the city")
# location1.save
